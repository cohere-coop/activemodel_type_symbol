# ActiveModel::Type::Symbol
![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/wecohere/activemodel_type_symbol.svg?branch=primary)

Symbols! They're awesome! Sadly, converting an attribute from a string to a
symbol and vice versa by hand is annoying, and validations don't quite work the
way you expect without type casting; which can result in hackneyed
workarounds like `def field=value; super(value.to_sym); end;` and `def field;
super&.to_sym; end;`

ActiveRecord 5 introduces the concept of *type casting* for attributes; which
beyond being a great way to leverage composition in your models; also allows us
to use symbols more fluidly!

Unfortunately, ActiveModel::Type (the default set of type converters) doesn't
include Symbol by default, so I'm tossing one up here so we can all party hardy
together until they slurp this code right on up into their codebase.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activemodel_type_symbol'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install activemodel_type_symbol

## Usage

#### Just... Hanging Out In The Ruby World
`ActiveModel::Type::Symbol.new.cast("value") # => :value`


#### In an ActiveRecord model
```
class YourFancyModel < ApplicationRecord
  validates_inclusion_of :some_field, in: %i(one two three)
  attribute :some_field, :symbol
end


model = YourFancyModel.new(some_field: "one")
model.some_field # => :one
model.valid?     # => true
```
## FAQ

#### Your first example is basically `to_sym` but longer
That's not a question. But yes, this safely wraps `to_sym` so that downstream
consumers of ActiveModel can use `ActiveModel::Type.lookup(:symbol)` to do
conversions.

#### Wait so this needs ActiveRecord?
Teeeccchnnicalllyyyyyy, no. `ActiveModel::Type` is theoretically generically
useable!

#### Why are you appending things to ActiveModel's namespace?
Because I'm gonna submit this as a patch, but wanted to make it generally
available before hand so people aren't forced to upgrade to get that sweet sweet
`ActiveModel::Type::Symbol`y goodness

#### Did you literally spend more time writing the README than you did the code?
NO. Uhh... I mean... Yes.......

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
